✅ METHOD 1 — Using pdf2image + Tesseract OCR (Most common way)
Install required libraries
pip install pdf2image pytesseract pillow


You also need to install Poppler (this converts PDF → image):

Download Windows poppler:
https://github.com/oschwartz10612/poppler-windows/releases/

Extract it and note the path, e.g.:

C:\poppler-24.02.0\Library\bin


//--------------------------------------------------how it's works-----------------

convert_from_path()
→ Converts each page of PDF into high-quality images

pytesseract.image_to_string()
→ OCR extracts text from each image

full_text collects all pages’ text
